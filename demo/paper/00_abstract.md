# Abstract

Boilerplate Paper is a tool for creating scientific papers, posters and slideshows in Markdown and convert them to different formats like Pdf, Word, PowerPoint or Html. Converting your Markdown files is done using Pandoc. Pandoc is open-source software created to convert documents from one format to another. Boilerplate Paper extends the functionality of Pandoc. It also comes with a set of recommended Vscode extensions to offer the optimal working experience for writing you papers, posters and slideshows in Markdown. To use the full feature set of Boilerplate Paper, some prerequisite software needs to be installed on your local computer, but you can already benefit from Boilerplate Paper without any software installed thanks to Github Actions. Boilerplate Paper comes with Github Actions preconfigured. These actions make it possible to build your documents without any software preinstalled on your local computer, using the servers of Github to do the work. With Boilerplate Paper it is possible to edit your paper from any device with internet access, using the Github online text editor, and download the latest Pdf-version of your paper built with Github Actions.
