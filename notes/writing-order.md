# Writing order vs. document order

A paper has a fixed format of ordered sections, but it's easier to write a paper in an order that differs from the order of those sections.

## Document order

1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Keywords
4. Introduction
5. Method
6. Results
7. Discussion
8. Conclusions
9. Acknowledgements
10. References
